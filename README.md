# Weekly Meal Planner

For this project we created a Weekly Meal Planner that helps us solve a couple of problems that we encounter in our daily lives focusing on food and nutrition. While looking for recipes to create, nutrition facts were often left out and didn’t give a convenient way to save these recipes/ingredients.  The first problem was not having all the functions we needed aggregated into one site. Also none of the websites we visited offered this service for free. Our next focus was to also implement an easy weekly planner where you can click and drop saved recipes to the days of the week you want to schedule them.

For this project we utilized a responsive CSS framework called Materialize giving it a more modern feel. For our backend we worked with Google’s Firebase to be able to save users meal plans in real time. The API’s that we used Included Edamam(a food and recipe API that included nutrition info), and both Google’s Maps and  Places to search for local grocery stores.

For future development we would like to implement a recommended recipe section that displays on the homepage. An online pantry that tells you what you already have in your homes pantry so your not purchasing items you already had.  We would also like to add an option to filter by diet type (vegan, vegetarian, paleo). We look forward to developing this application more in the future.
